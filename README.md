# PlantDB

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.0.2.
This is my first project in Angular after building 2 test projects from online guides.

## App Idea
The idea of this app is to display a list of 4,600 plants found in Florida and then to allow narrowing down by selecting a plant family from a list of available families.
